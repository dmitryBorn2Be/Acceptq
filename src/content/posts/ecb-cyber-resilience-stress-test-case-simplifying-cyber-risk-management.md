In July 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) concluded its first Cyber Resilience Stress Test, assessing 109 regional and global banks across the EU. This exercise evaluated banks' capacity to respond to and recover from a simulated, severe cybersecurity incident in which attackers compromised the databases of core banking systems.

ECB stress tests have traditionally focused on banks' financial and economic resilience. However, increased cyber incidents have led to digital and cyber risk management becoming a top supervisory priority, alongside macro-financial, geopolitical, and environmental concerns.

## Insights from the ECB Stress Test

The results of the stress test highlighted several critical yet familiar areas for improvement, such as business continuity and third-party risk management. Despite widespread awareness, these areas remain challenging due to their complexity, requiring extensive collaboration across organisational silos. Robust, sustainable solutions often elude many institutions, even though both regulators and organisations recognize these risks.

## Where to Begin?

Managing cyber risk isn't a one-time project but a continuous discipline that must balance structure with flexibility. Proactive risk management involves:

- Identifying and assessing key cyber risks.
- Documenting critical processes and assets.
- Developing comprehensive response plans.

Meanwhile, flexibility is essential for effective detection, response, and recovery, ensuring readiness for evolving threats.

Each control—preventive, detective, or responsive—demands people, processes, and technology integration. Effective governance and metrics are crucial for tracking performance, ensuring controls function as intended, and delivering a return on investment. As Deming's famous principle states, "If it can't be measured, it can't be managed." This approach is reinforced through ongoing audits, security assessments, penetration testing, red-teaming, and tabletop exercises.

## The Complexity of Cyber Risk Management

Cyber risk management is inherently complex, influenced by business operations, technology use, geographical presence, and the evolving security landscape. Companies must address various risk domains—proactive prevention, detection, and recovery—while defending an expanding digital perimeter shaped by remote work, cloud adoption, and digital transformation.
Additionally, the threat landscape is ever-evolving. Cyber adversaries, ranging from nation-state actors to opportunistic criminals, are constantly developing new tactics, including leveraging AI, cryptocurrencies, and quantum computing.
